To use this app, install this repo on both a Bela and your personal machine, both of which need to be connected to the same network. Then switch over to your local machine and start the project on http://bela.local before installing the GUI.

As a prerequisite, you will need NodeJS installed, which is available from most established package manages (apt, homebrew, etc...) or you can download it directly online. Then, from inside the project directory, run:

```bash
cd react-app
npm install
npm start
```

This will install and launch the GUI in your default browser, at http://localhost:3000, and upon successfully connecting to Bela you can begin playing. :)
