To use this app, install this repo on both a Bela and your personal machine, both of which need to be connected to the same network. Then start the project on http://bela.local and switch over to your local machine to install the GUI.

As a pre-requisite, you will need NodeJS installed, which is available from most established package manages (apt, homebrew, etc...) or you can download it directly online. Then, from inside the project directory run

```bash
cd react-app
npm i
npm start
```

This will launch the GUI in your browser, at http://localhost:3000, and upon successfully connecting to Bela you can begin playing. :)
